# Summary

`GAS` implements the Generalized Autoregressive 
Score (GAS) framework in R (@R). The GAS package
provides functions to simulate univariate and multivariate GAS processes, estimate the
GAS parameters and to make time series forecasts. Full description of the algorithm and numerous applications are available in @ArdiaEtAl2016a and @ArdiaEtAl2016b. The latest version 
of the package is available at 'https://github.com/LeopoldoCatania/GAS'.
